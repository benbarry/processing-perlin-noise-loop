# Processing Perlin Noise Loop
I wanted to create a seamlessly looping video using Processing where my artwork was being modified by moving across a 2D Perlin noise space. I had a difficult time finding information on how to do this, so I'm sharing my solutions in hopes it may help someone else.

* Perlin Noise Tiled Loop was the first solution I came up with.
* Perlin Noise Loop is the simpler and better solution I eventually arrived at.
