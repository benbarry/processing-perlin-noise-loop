# Processing Perlin Noise Loop
I wanted to create a seamlessly looping video using Processing where my artwork was being modified by moving across a 2D Perlin noise space. I had a difficult time finding information on how to do this, so I'm sharing my solutions in hopes it may help someone else.

* `perlin_noise_tiled_loop` was the first solution I came up with.
* `perlin_noise_loop` is the simpler and better solution I eventually arrived at.

Update (June 2020). Here is a better solution to this I just came across:
